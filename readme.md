# Tic Tac Toe - Console Edition

Created because I hadn't programmed in Java for at least 8 years. So I wanted to relearn some basic Java before I dove into some more complicated stuff.

## Features

- 2 or 3 players
- Game Board up to 10x10 squares

## To Run

1. Download `tictactoe.jar`
2. Run `java -jar tictactoe.jar`
